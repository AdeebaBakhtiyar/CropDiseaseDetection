Crop Disease Classification Using CNN + SVM

Overview
This project uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification to detect crop diseases from leaf images. The model provides real-time predictions through a Flask API. It aims to help farmers identify crop diseases early and take necessary actions to protect their crops.

Features
Disease Classification: Classifies diseases in crops based on leaf images.
CNN + SVM: Utilizes CNN for feature extraction and SVM for classification.
Flask API: A simple API for users to upload images and get disease predictions.

Dataset
The dataset consists of images of crop leaves that are labeled with the corresponding disease types. These images are used for training the CNN model.

Technologies
Python
TensorFlow (for CNN)
Scikit-learn (for SVM)
Flask (for API)
